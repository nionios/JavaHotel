# Building the Project

- To build the project, run the build.sh script in the root directory
with command (`./build.sh`)

- The project jar/class files were compiled with OpenJDK version
 (build 11.0.15+10), this is recommended for building, since **in later
versions `rmic` needed to build the HRImpl_Stub file is deprecated**
